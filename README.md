## Project Description
The Number Classification System is a simple C program that classifies a given number based on different conditions.  
It checks whether the number is positive, negative, or zero, determines if it is even or odd, and identifies whether the number is a prime number.

## Why This Project Was Created
This project was created to understand the use of:
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Looping statements (`for`)
- Modulo operator (`%`)
- Basic input and output operations in C  

It helps in building logical thinking and problem-solving skills using the C programming language.

## Utility of the Project
- Useful for beginners to understand number classification
- Helps in learning decision making in programming
- Can be used as a base for more complex mathematical programs
- Suitable for academic and lab practice

---

## Future Scope
- Extend the program to classify multiple numbers
- Add checks for palindrome and Armstrong numbers
- Implement the program using functions
- Convert the program into a menu-driven application
